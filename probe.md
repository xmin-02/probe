# PROBE — Custom Syzkaller for Exploit-Oriented Kernel Fuzzing

## Scope

- **Modification target**: `syzkaller/` directory ONLY
- **Linux kernel source**: NEVER modified (kernel .config changes are allowed)
- **Goal**: Transform syzkaller from a general-purpose fuzzer into an exploit-oriented fuzzer that focuses on discovering and validating actually exploitable vulnerabilities

## Target Vulnerability Types

- **UAF (Use-After-Free)**: alloc → use → free → reuse patterns
- **OOB (Out-of-Bounds)**: buffer size/offset boundary violations

```

## Phase 1: Crash Filtering & Dedup Pipeline [DONE]

**Goal**: Eliminate noise and deduplicate crashes while preserving variant diversity.

**Current problem**: syzkaller treats all crashes equally — WARNING, LOCKDEP, hangs, and KASAN UAF writes all get the same treatment. Duplicate crashes flood the results.

### 1a. Crash Severity Tiers

**Modification targets**:
- `pkg/report/crash/` — crash type classification
- `pkg/manager/` — crash storage and reporting logic

**Implementation**:
- Use existing `impactOrder` ranking in `pkg/report/impact_score.go`
- Add filtering layer in manager: only prioritize crashes with high impact scores
- Crash severity tiers:
  - **Tier 1 (Critical)**: KASANInvalidFree, KASANUseAfterFreeWrite, KASANWrite, KASANUseAfterFreeRead, KASANRead
  - **Tier 2 (Important)**: OOB variants, KFENCEInvalidFree, NullPtrDerefBUG, Warning, Bug, UBSAN, LockdepBug, AtomicSleep, UnexpectedReboot; also the default for any unclassified crash type
  - **Tier 3 (Stats-only)**: LostConnection, SyzFailure, Hang, DoS, MemoryLeak (explicit list only)
- Tier 3 handling: **statistics only** (no logs, no reports, no repro)
  - Record title + count in `tier3-stat.json` (e.g., "WARNING in xxx: 47 times")
  - No disk-heavy storage — only counters
  - Viewable in web dashboard (collapsed section)
  - Never triggers Focus Mode or repro attempts

### 1b. Crash Deduplication Pipeline

**Key principle**: Group, don't delete. Same crash point can have different trigger paths with different exploitability.

```
Crashes (thousands/day)
    |
    +-- Stage 1: Exact duplicate removal
    |       Match: title + stack trace + trigger program hash
    |       Only removes 100% identical crashes
    |
    +-- Stage 2: Grouping (NOT deletion)
    |       Group by: same stack trace / crash point
    |       But PRESERVE different trigger programs (syscall sequences)
    |       → Each group contains multiple variants
    |
    |       Example: "UAF at kfree+0x42" group (5 variants)
    |         ├─ Variant A: close() → read()      (read UAF)
    |         ├─ Variant B: close() → write()     (write UAF) ← more dangerous
    |         ├─ Variant C: close() → ioctl()     (ioctl UAF)
    |         ├─ Variant D: munmap() → read()     (different free path)
    |         └─ Variant E: munmap() → mmap()     (reallocation attempt)
    |
    +-- Stage 3: Impact score filter
    |       Tier 3: statistics only (title + count), no storage
    |       Tier 1/2: proceed to grouping + full storage
    |
    +-- Stage 4: AI analysis (group-level, not per-crash)
            Send: group representative + all variant trigger programs
            → LLM identifies which variant is most exploitable
            → Variant diversity = more options for Focus Mode
```

**Why grouping matters**: Same crash point ≠ same exploitability. A write-UAF and read-UAF at the same location have vastly different exploit potential. Deleting "duplicates" loses attack vectors that Focus Mode needs.

**VariantPrograms cap**: Loading variant programs is capped at `MaxVariants` (100) to prevent excessive disk I/O when a crash group accumulates thousands of variants.

## Phase 2: Focus Mode [DONE]

**Goal**: When a high-severity crash is found, switch to intensive exploitation of that finding.

**Current behavior**: Crash found → triage → minimize → smash (25 mutations) → move on.

**New behavior**:
```
Normal Mode (exploration)
    |
    +-- Crash detected
          |
          +-- Low severity → Standard processing (25x smash)
          |
          +-- High severity (Tier 1) → FOCUS MODE
                |
                +-- 1. Intensive mutation of crash program
                |     +-- 300 iterations (vs 25 in smash)
                |     +-- Standard prog.Mutate() (Phase 4 adds UAF/OOB-specific)
                |
                +-- 2. Diminishing returns exit
                |     +-- 50 consecutive iterations with no new coverage → early exit
                |     +-- Tracks max signal growth for progress detection
                |
                +-- 3. Concurrency limits
                      +-- Max 1 concurrent focus job
                      +-- Pending queue: up to 8 candidates queued while focus active
                      +-- On completion, next pending candidate auto-launches
                      +-- Same crash title never re-focused
                      +-- Alternate(2): 1 focus request per 2 queue polls
```

**Implementation**:
- `pkg/fuzzer/job.go` — `focusJob` type (300 iters, diminishing returns exit)
- `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go` — `focusQueue`, `AddFocusCandidate()`, focus state tracking
- `pkg/fuzzer/cover.go` — `MaxSignalLen()` for progress detection
- `pkg/fuzzer/stats.go` — `statJobsFocus`, `statExecFocus`
- `syz-manager/manager.go` — Tier 1 crash → Focus Mode trigger bridge

**Queue priority** (implemented):
```
1. triageCandidateQueue
2. candidateQueue
3. triageQueue
4. focusQueue (Alternate 2)  ← PROBE: high-severity crash intensive mutation
5. smashQueue (Alternate 3)
6. genFuzz
```

**Logging strategy**:
- Entry: `Logf(0)` — `PROBE: focus mode started for 'X' (tier N)`
- Exit:  `Logf(0)` — `PROBE: focus mode ended for 'X' — iters, new_coverage, exit_reason, duration`
- Mid-session: no logs (internal counters only, summarized at exit)

## Phase 3: AI-Guided Fuzzing — **DONE**

**Goal**: Integrate LLM into the full fuzzing pipeline — crash exploitability analysis, coverage strategy, seed generation, mutation tuning, and Focus target recommendations.

**Architecture**: 2-step batch cycle every 1 hour:
- **Step A**: Crash analysis (individual API calls per crash group, scoring 0-100)
- **Step B**: Fuzzing strategy (single API call with coverage+crash summary, produces syscall weights, seeds, mutation hints, focus targets)

**Model**: Configurable (recommended: Claude Sonnet 4.5, ~$1.25/day). Multi-provider support (Anthropic + OpenAI-compatible).

**Config** (`probe.cfg`):
```json
"ai_triage": {
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    "api_key": "sk-ant-api03-xxx",
    "max_tier": 2
}
```
Provider auto-detected from model name (`claude-*` → Anthropic, otherwise → OpenAI).

### What was implemented

**New package `pkg/aitriage/`**:
- `aitriage.go` — Core types (TriageResult, StrategyResult, CostTracker), Triager with 1-hour batch loop
- `client.go` — LLMClient interface + Anthropic/OpenAI implementations (raw net/http, 3x retry, 60s timeout)
- `prompt_crash.go` — KASAN report parser, crash exploitability prompt (5 criteria, JSON output)
- `prompt_strategy.go` — FuzzingSnapshot collection, strategy prompt (syscall weights, seeds, mutations, focus)

**Strategy application**:
- `prog/prio.go`: `ChoiceTable.ApplyWeights()` — external syscall weight multipliers on cumulative sums
- `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go`: `InjectSeed()` — parse syzkaller program text, inject as triage candidate
- `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go`: `ApplyAIWeights()` — forward weights to ChoiceTable
- Focus targets → `AddFocusCandidate()` for high-score crashes

**Dashboard** (4-tab layout):
- `main.html`: AI Score column on crash table (color-coded: red 70+, yellow 40-69, green 0-39)
- `crash.html`: AI Exploitability Analysis section (score, class, vuln type)
- `ai.html`: `/ai` (Dashboard tab) — summary cards (analyzed, high-risk, pending, clusters, SyzGPT), 3-way cost table (Claude LLM / GPT Embedding / Combined), quick links, full console with real-time polling
- `aitriage.html`: `/ai/triage` (AI Triage tab) — action buttons (Analyze/Strategize), crash exploitability table, strategy details, API call history, filtered console (`[Step A/B/C]`)
- `aiembeddings.html`: `/ai/embeddings` (Embeddings tab) — Embed Now button, summary cards, cluster/embedding tables, filtered console (`[Embeddings]`)
- `aianalytics.html`: `/ai/analytics` (Analytics tab) — Google Charts (cost, score, exploit class, API calls, crash timeline), cost efficiency metrics, SyzGPT performance, embedding analytics
- `aicrash.html`: `/ai/crash?id=` — detailed single crash analysis (back link → `/ai/triage`)
- `common.html`: AI tab in navigation bar (uses `hasPrefix` for sub-path highlighting)

**Manager integration** (`syz-manager/ai_triage.go`):
- Triager initialization from config, background goroutine
- Callbacks: GetCrashes, GetSnapshot, OnTriageResult, OnStrategyResult
- Score >= 70 → auto-trigger Focus Mode
- Manual triggers: POST `/api/ai/analyze`, POST `/api/ai/strategize`

**Graceful degradation**: No `ai_triage` config → triager nil, AI disabled, `/ai` shows "disabled", fuzzing unchanged.

**Operational improvements**:
- **Step A re-analysis**: Crashes are re-analyzed when variant count triples since last analysis (e.g., 5→15 variants), capturing evolving exploit potential as new trigger paths are discovered
- **Cost recovery dedup**: Timestamp-based guard prevents double-counting when recovering cost history from triage result files at startup
- **Auto-refresh**: `/ai` page automatically reloads when LLM batch completes (tracks running→complete transition)

### Cost Estimate (24h, ~126K input + ~58K output tokens)

| Model | 24h USD | 24h KRW | Note |
|-------|---------|---------|------|
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | $1.25 | ~1,810 | Recommended |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | $0.42 | ~609 | Budget |
| GPT-4o | $0.90 | ~1,305 | OpenAI |
| GPT-4o-mini | $0.05 | ~73 | Minimum |

## Phase 4: Practical Hardening — **DONE**

**Goal**: Practical improvements to boost UAF/OOB crash discovery before Phase 5.

**Modified files**: `setup/probe.cfg`, `pkg/manager/crash.go`, `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go`, `prog/mutation.go`, `prog/size.go`, `prog/hints.go`

### 4a. kasan_multi_shot + Severity Escalation — **DONE**
- Removed `oops=panic` and added `kasan_multi_shot` to kernel cmdline
- Added `escalateCrashType()`: scans all reports (primary + tail) for the most severe crash type when multiple KASAN reports exist in one execution
- Called from `SaveCrash()` before tier classification

### 4b. Fault Injection × Focus Mode — **DONE**
- When Focus Mode starts for a high-severity crash, also spawns `faultInjectionJob` for each call in the crash program
- Error paths (incomplete cleanup) are a major source of UAFs
- Reuses existing `statExecFaultInject` counter, jobs go through `focusQueue`

### 4c. Hints OOB Boundary Extension — **DONE**
- Extended `checkConstArg()` in `prog/hints.go` to generate boundary±1/±2 variants after standard replacers
- Standard hints generate values that PASS comparisons; OOB variants generate values that FAIL boundary checks (off-by-one/off-by-two)
- Applies `uselessHint` filter to avoid invalid boundary values

### 4d. LenType Priority Boost + OOB-Aware Mutation — **DONE**
- Boosted `LenType` mutation priority from `0.1 * maxPriority` (6.4) to `0.4 * maxPriority` (25.6)
- Added OOB-specific strategy to `mutateSize()` (20% chance): off-by-one above/below, double size, zero size, page-size overshoot
- Strategy uses actual buffer size (from `assignSizesCall`) as reference, `preserve=true` prevents recalculation

## Phase 5: eBPF Runtime Monitor — **DONE**

**Goal**: Real-time kernel heap state tracking for exploitability assessment.

**Constraint**: Runs inside Guest VM, attaches to existing kernel tracepoints. NO kernel source modification.

```

### 5a. BPF C Program — **DONE**
- `executor/ebpf/probe_ebpf.bpf.c` — hooks `tracepoint/kmem/kfree` and `tracepoint/kmem/kmalloc`
- LRU hash map (8192 entries) tracks recently freed pointers with timestamps
- Array map stores per-execution metrics: alloc_count, free_count, reuse_count, rapid_reuse_count, min_reuse_delay_ns, double_free_count, size_mismatch_count
- Detects slab reuse (free→alloc of same pointer) and rapid reuse (< 100us = UAF-favorable)
- **Double-free detection**: kfree checks if ptr already exists in freed_objects (freed twice without intervening alloc)
- **Size-mismatch detection**: kmalloc flags when `bytes_alloc > 2 * bytes_req && bytes_alloc >= 128` (cross-cache/slab waste)

### 5b. BPF Loader — **DONE**
- `tools/syz-ebpf-loader/main.go` — standalone Go binary using `cilium/ebpf`
- Loads BPF ELF object, attaches tracepoints, pins maps+links to `/sys/fs/bpf/probe/`
- Static binary for VM deployment; exits after setup (BPF persists in kernel)

### 5c. FlatBuffers Schema Extension — **DONE**
- Added 8 fields to `ProgInfoRaw` in `pkg/flatrpc/flatrpc.fbs`:
  - `ebpf_alloc_count`, `ebpf_free_count`, `ebpf_reuse_count`, `ebpf_rapid_reuse_count` (uint32)
  - `ebpf_min_reuse_ns` (uint64), `ebpf_uaf_score` (uint32)
  - `ebpf_double_free_count` (uint32, VT=26), `ebpf_size_mismatch_count` (uint32, VT=28)
- Backward compatible: default 0 for old executors
- Manual hand-edit of generated `flatrpc.h` (C++) and `flatrpc.go` (Go) since flatc version mismatch prevents regeneration

### 5d. Executor C++ Integration — **DONE**
- `executor_linux.h`: `ebpf_init()` opens pinned metrics map via raw `bpf()` syscall; `access()` check before `BPF_OBJ_GET` to silently skip when map not yet pinned
- `ebpf_read_and_reset()`: reads metrics + zeros for next execution (atomic)
- `executor.cc`: init on startup (with retry in `execute_one()` for late BPF deployment), clear before execution, child writes metrics to `OutputData` shared memory BEFORE `close_fds()`, runner reads from shared memory in `finish_output()`
- UAF score formula: rapid_reuse > 0 (+50), min_delay < 10us (+30), reuse > 5 (+20), double_free > 0 (=100 override), size_mismatch > 3 (+10), capped at 100

### 5e. Manager Deployment — **DONE**
- Manager copies `syz-ebpf-loader` + `probe_ebpf.bpf.o` to each VM at startup
- Runs loader via shell command chain before executor starts
- bpffs mount added to VM fstab (`tools/trixie/etc/fstab`)
- Graceful degradation: if eBPF fails, executor returns zero metrics, fuzzing continues
- **Bugfix (v1)**: All eBPF command output redirected to `/dev/null` to prevent crash reporter interference
- **Bugfix (v2)**: Root cause was VM image missing bpffs mountpoint + loader hang potential. Fixed: `mkdir -p /sys/fs/bpf` before mount, `timeout 10` on loader to prevent hang blocking executor, loader output saved to `/tmp/probe-ebpf.log` for debugging. VM image fstab updated with bpffs entry. BPF header `accounted` field removed for kernel 6.1.20 compatibility.
- **Bugfix (v3)**: `ebpf_init()` was called too early in `executor.cc` (before shmem fd operations), so `BPF_OBJ_GET` would steal fd 5/6 (`kMaxSignalFd`/`kCoverFilterFd`) when the runner didn't provide coverage filter. The `fcntl()` check then misidentified the BPF map fd as a shmem fd, causing `mmap` to fail on all VMs. Fixed: moved `ebpf_init()` to after all shmem fd operations (`mmap_input`, `mmap_output`, CoverFilter setup) in executor.cc exec mode. Also cleaned up diagnostic code: removed `/tmp/shmem-diag.txt` file writing from `shmem.h`, removed tier3 raw output logging from `manager.go`. Kept improved error message in `shmem.h` (with errno, fd, size info).
- **Bugfix (v4)**: eBPF metrics were always 0 on the Go (manager) side despite BPF programs collecting data. Root cause: `close_fds()` in `common_linux.h` calls `close_range(3, MAX_FDS, 0)` which closes ALL fds >= 3 including the BPF map fd. The eBPF read in `finish_output()` happened AFTER `close_fds()` in a different process (runner), so `BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM` failed on the already-closed fd. Fixed: (1) exec child reads eBPF metrics BEFORE `close_fds()` and writes them to `OutputData` shared memory via atomic fields, (2) runner's `finish_output()` reads from shared memory instead of calling `ebpf_read_and_reset()` directly, (3) added `ebpf_init()` retry in `execute_one()` for late BPF deployment, (4) added `access()` check in `ebpf_init()` before `BPF_OBJ_GET`. Verified: alloc/free counts non-zero from first execution.
- **Bugfix (v5)**: eBPF UAF score saturated to 100 for ALL programs over time (~5000+ executions). Root cause: `freed_objects` LRU map was never cleared between program executions, so freed pointers from program N appeared as "reuse" in program N+1, causing unbounded accumulation. Fixed: `ebpf_read_and_reset()` now iterates `freed_objects` map with `BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY` + `BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM` loop (all 8192 entries per reset) to clear stale entries. Opened pinned freed_objects map via `ebpf_open_pinned()` helper alongside metrics map.
- **Bugfix (v6)**: Saturation guard in `finish_output()` — if `reuse > 500` (physically impossible per single program execution), suppress scoring entirely. Prevents residual saturation from overwhelming Focus Mode.

### 5f. Fuzzer Feedback — **DONE**
- `processResult()`: tracks `statEbpfAllocs`, `statEbpfReuses`, `statEbpfUafDetected`, `statEbpfDoubleFree`, `statEbpfSizeMismatch` stats
- Non-crashing UAF detection: UAF score ≥ 70 triggers `AddFocusCandidate()` → Focus Mode
- **Double-free Focus**: Any double-free detection triggers Focus Mode
- **Unified eBPF cooldown**: Both UAF and double-free Focus triggers share a single 5-min cooldown (`lastEbpfFocus` timestamp) to prevent Focus over-triggering
- Stats visible in web dashboard: `ebpf reuses` (rate), `ebpf uaf` (count), `ebpf double-free` (count), `ebpf size-mismatch` (rate) — all on `ebpf` graph

### 5g. Stability Hardening — **DONE**
Five production stability fixes applied to fuzzer core:

1. **eBPF saturation guard** (`executor.cc`): `reuse > 500` suppresses UAF scoring. Prevents residual freed_objects accumulation from causing all programs to score 100.
2. **Candidates counter fix** (`fuzzer.go`): `InjectSeed()` and `InjectProgram()` no longer use `progCandidate` flag or increment `statCandidates`. AI-injected seeds are not corpus triage candidates — mixing them caused the counter to go negative over time.
3. **Focus job cooldown** (`fuzzer.go`): `drainFocusPending()` enforces 2-min minimum between consecutive Focus jobs. Stale pending entries cleared on cooldown miss to prevent unbounded growth of the pending queue.
4. **ChoiceTable RWMutex** (`fuzzer.go`): `ctMu` changed from `sync.Mutex` to `sync.RWMutex`. `ChoiceTable()` (read-only, called on every mutation) uses `RLock()` for better concurrency. Writes (`updateChoiceTable`) continue using exclusive `Lock()`.
5. **focusTitles memory cap** (`fuzzer.go`): `focusTitles` dedup map capped at 10,000 entries. When exceeded, map is cleared and refilled from active Focus jobs only, preventing unbounded memory growth in long runs.

### Key Design Decisions
- **Separate loader + executor reads**: Loader handles complex BPF loading (cilium/ebpf), executor does simple map reads (raw bpf() syscall). Clean separation.
- **Tracepoints over kprobes**: `tracepoint/kmem/kfree` and `tracepoint/kmem/kmalloc` are stable ABI.
- **LRU hash map**: freed_objects uses LRU to auto-evict old entries, preventing unbounded growth.
- **Graceful degradation**: If eBPF isn't available, fuzzing continues normally with zero metrics.

### Build
```bash
cd syzkaller
make              # Builds executor with eBPF support
make probe_ebpf   # Builds BPF object + loader to bin/linux_amd64/
```

## Development Rules

1. **Plan before code**: Before implementing each Phase, MUST discuss and agree on a detailed development plan first. No coding without prior discussion.
2. **Update docs**: After significant changes, update both `probe.md` (EN) and `probe_kor.md` (KR), then push to GitHub.
3. **Scope**: Only modify `syzkaller/` directory. Never touch Linux kernel source.

## Implementation Order

| Phase | Component | Difficulty | Impact | Dependencies |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Crash Filtering & Dedup Pipeline | Low | Immediate noise reduction + variant preservation | None | **DONE** |
| 2 | Focus Mode | Medium | Deep exploitation of high-severity findings | Phase 1 (needs severity tiers) | **DONE** |
| 3 | AI Triage (Claude Haiku 4.5) | Medium | Smart group-level crash analysis | Phase 1 (needs dedup groups), Phase 2 (needs Focus Mode) |
| 4 | Practical Hardening (UAF/OOB) | Medium | Higher vuln discovery rate | None (can parallel with 2-3) | **DONE** |
| 5 | eBPF Runtime Monitor | High | Real-time exploitability feedback | Phase 2 (needs Focus Mode feedback loop) | **DONE** |
| 6 | AI Cost Optimization + Data-Driven Scheduling | Medium | -50% API cost, DEzzer auto-optimization, SyzMini minimization | Phase 3 (needs AI integration) | **DONE** |

**Critical path**: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 (sequential dependency)
**Parallel track**: Phase 4 can start any time independently

## Phase 6: AI Cost Optimization + Data-Driven Scheduling — **DONE**

Phase 6 focuses on AI API cost reduction and data-driven fuzzing optimization. After deep analysis, 2 of the original 6 items were removed (Prompt Caching, Tiered Routing — insufficient benefit) and 2 were significantly redesigned.

### 6a. Batch API Migration — **DONE**

**Goal**: Use Anthropic Message Batches API (`/v1/messages/batches`) for 50% cost reduction on crash analysis. Strategy calls (1/hour) remain synchronous.

**Files modified**: `pkg/aitriage/client.go` (BatchClient interface + Anthropic implementation), `pkg/aitriage/batch.go` (new: state persistence), `pkg/aitriage/aitriage.go` (stepA batch/sync branching)

**Key design**:
- Batch mode activates when: Anthropic provider + 2+ pending crashes
- 30-second polling, 30-minute timeout, then cancel + sync fallback
- Disk persistence (`ai-batch-state.json`) for crash recovery
- Failed batch requests retry synchronously (max 3)
- OpenAI provider always uses sync mode (no batch support)

### 6d'. Per-Source Coverage Metrics — **DONE**

**Goal**: Track coverage gains per source (focus/smash/fuzz) for scheduling optimization data.

**Files modified**: `pkg/fuzzer/stats.go` (3 new stat.Val), `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go` (processResult source attribution)

**Metrics**: `statFocusCovGain`, `statSmashCovGain`, `statFuzzCovGain` — visible on dashboard as "source cov" stacked graph.

### 6e. SyzMini Influence-Based Minimization — **DONE**

**Goal**: Reduce minimization cost by ~60% using influence-based call removal ordering (SyzMini, ATC 2025).

**Files modified**: `prog/minimization.go` (removeCalls Phase 3 with influence probing)

**How it works**: For `MinimizeCorpus` mode, before removing calls sequentially:
1. **Influence probing**: Try removing each call once to check if it breaks the signal (max 30 calls)
2. **Sort**: Removable calls first (influence=0), then non-removable
3. **Remove**: Safe removals first triggers cascade effects, reducing total pred calls

Non-corpus modes (PatchTest, CrashSnapshot) use the original end→begin order.

### 6f. DEzzer — Hybrid TS+DE Mutation Optimizer — **DONE**

**Goal**: Track per-operator mutation success rates and auto-optimize weights via Thompson Sampling (primary) + Differential Evolution (secondary).

**Files modified**: `prog/mutation.go` (string return value), `pkg/fuzzer/dezzer.go` (TS+DE hybrid engine), `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go` (DEzzer integration, crash bonus), `pkg/fuzzer/job.go` (operator capture, FeedbackSource), `pkg/fuzzer/stats.go` (operator stats), `pkg/aitriage/aitriage.go` (DEzzerStatusData extended), `pkg/aitriage/prompt_strategy.go` (TS+DE prompt), `syz-manager/ai_triage.go` (snapshot wiring)

**4-Layer Architecture**:
```
Layer 1: DefaultMutateOpts (constant)     — Squash:50, Splice:200, ...
Layer 2: AI Base Weights (hourly)         — multiplier set by SetAIMutationHints
Layer 3: TS Delta (real-time, ±20%)       — per-operator Bayesian adaptation
Layer 4: DE Correction (real-time, ±5%)   — operator synergy search
Final weights = Default × AI Base × TS Delta × DE Correction
```

**Thompson Sampling (primary)**:
- Beta-Bernoulli posteriors per operator (binary success/failure signal)
- Time-based decay (30s intervals, factor 0.9, ~3.3 min half-life)
- Path-weighted feedback: mutateProgRequest=1x, smashJob=2x, focusJob=3x
- IPW correction for selection bias (cap 5x)
- Saturation detection: when mean prob < 0.1%, switches to relative performance mode
- Crash bonus: alpha += 10 for crash-triggering operators

**Differential Evolution (secondary)**:
- ±5% correction range (vs TS ±20%), independent fitness (squared error from ideal)
- Conflict detection: when TS and DE disagree on 3+/5 operators, DE dampened to ±2%
- Population=10, lazy evolution every 100 records, stagnation restart

**Risk Mitigations**:
- Warm-up period: first 1000 records use neutral delta (Default × AI Base only)
- Exploration rounds: every 5000 records, 50 records with neutral delta
- Selective AI reset: small change (Σ|Δ|<0.3) → 30% TS preserve + DE kept; large → full reset
- AI direction hint injection: AI base increase → alpha+2, decrease → beta+2
- Phase 12 ML feature collection: ring buffer of 100K (timestamp, op, gain, source, saturated)

**mutation.go change**: `Mutate()` and `MutateWithOpts()` now return `string` (operator name). Go allows ignoring return values, so 12+ test callsites and tool callsites need no modification.

### 6f'. Focus Coverage Feedback Loop — **DONE**

**Goal**: Feed focus job results + DEzzer state back into AI strategy prompts.

**Files modified**: `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go` (FocusJobResult, buffer), `pkg/fuzzer/job.go` (result recording), `pkg/aitriage/aitriage.go` (FuzzingSnapshot fields), `pkg/aitriage/prompt_strategy.go` (prompt formatting), `syz-manager/ai_triage.go` (snapshot wiring)

**Prompt formatting**: ≤5 results → full detail; 6-20 → 3 recent detail + aggregate summary (~300 tokens cap).

### Build

```bash
cd syzkaller && make host  # Builds all host tools including syz-manager
```

## Phase 7: Core Detection Enhancement — **DONE**

CO-RE (Compile Once, Run Everywhere) based infrastructure for portable kprobe access, plus 5 sub-tasks enhancing vulnerability detection capabilities.

### 0. CO-RE Infrastructure

**Goal**: Build environment for portable kprobe programs using `vmlinux.h` + libbpf CO-RE headers.

**Changes**:
- Generated `vmlinux.h` from kernel BTF via `bpftool btf dump` (added to `.gitignore`)
- Vendored libbpf headers (`bpf_helpers.h`, `bpf_tracing.h`, `bpf_core_read.h`) into `executor/ebpf/bpf/`
- Rewrote `probe_ebpf.bpf.h` to use `vmlinux.h` instead of manual type definitions
- Build: `clang -O2 -g -target bpf -D__TARGET_ARCH_x86 -I executor/ebpf/ -I executor/ebpf/bpf/ -c executor/ebpf/probe_ebpf.bpf.c -o executor/ebpf/probe_ebpf.bpf.o`

### 7d. Privilege Escalation Detection — **DONE**

**Goal**: Detect `commit_creds()` calls via kprobe to identify privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

**Dual strategy**: `commit_creds_count` (all sandboxes, informational) + `priv_esc_count` (uid!=0→uid==0, sandbox_setuid only).

**BPF program**: `kprobe_commit_creds` — CO-RE reads `new_cred->uid.val` and `task->real_cred->uid.val`.

**Scoring**: `priv_esc_count > 0` → UAF score = 100 (top priority); `commit_creds_count > 0` → +5.

**Files modified**: `executor/ebpf/probe_ebpf.bpf.h`, `probe_ebpf.bpf.c`, `executor_linux.h`, `executor.cc`, `flatrpc.fbs`, `flatrpc.go`, `flatrpc.h`, `syz-ebpf-loader/main.go`, `pkg/fuzzer/stats.go`, `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go`

### 7c. Cross-Cache Precise Detection — **DONE**

**Goal**: Replace size-mismatch heuristic with cache-name-based tracking via kprobe on `kmem_cache_free`.

**Design**: `cache_freed` LRU map (ptr → cache_name_hash), `kprobe_cache_free` stores hash on free, `trace_cache_alloc` checks if ptr was freed from a different cache.

**Scoring**: `cross_cache_count > 0` → +20; `cross_cache_count > 3` → +40.

**Files modified**: Same executor/flatrpc pipeline as 7d, plus `cache_freed` BPF map in `probe_ebpf.bpf.c`.

### 7b'. Slab-Pair Boosting — **DONE**

**Goal**: Collect per-call-site alloc/free patterns from eBPF, provide to AI strategy prompts.

**Design**: `slab_sites` LRU_HASH map (512 entries), updated in existing `trace_kmalloc`/`trace_kfree` tracepoints. Manager reads pinned map via cilium/ebpf.

**AI integration**: Strategy prompt includes top-10 slab sites with labels (allocator-only, deallocator-only, over-freeing, under-freeing, balanced).

**Files modified**: `probe_ebpf.bpf.c` (slab_sites map), `syz-ebpf-loader/main.go` (pin), `syz-manager/ai_triage.go` (readSlabSites), `pkg/aitriage/prompt_strategy.go` (prompt section)

### 7e. GPTrace Embedding Dedup — **DONE**

**Goal**: Semantic crash deduplication using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small vectors + cosine similarity clustering.

**Design**: `EmbeddingClient` (separate cost tracker from main LLM), `ClusterState` (agglomerative clustering, threshold=0.85), batch processing in `stepEmbeddings()`.

**Config**: `embedding_model`, `embedding_api_key` fields in `ai_triage` config block. Missing → graceful skip.

**Dashboard**: `/ai/embeddings` page with summary cards (total embeddings, clusters, cost) + cluster table + embedded crashes table. Tab navigation: AI Dashboard / Analytics / Embeddings.

**Files modified**: `pkg/aitriage/embedding.go` (new), `pkg/aitriage/cluster.go` (new), `pkg/aitriage/aitriage.go`, `pkg/mgrconfig/config.go`, `pkg/manager/http.go`, `html/aiembeddings.html` (new), `html/ai.html`

### 7a. SyzGPT Seed Generation — **DONE**

**Goal**: Generate seed programs for low-frequency syscalls (LFS) via LLM to expand coverage.

**Design**: Manager computes LFS list (EnabledCalls with coverage < 3), builds dependency chains using `ForeachCallType` + `ResourceDesc.Ctors`, finds corpus examples. `stepC()` in batch cycle generates up to 10 programs per hour. Programs validated via `prog.Deserialize()` (NonStrict), invalid → discarded.

**Prompt**: System prompt with syzkaller format specification + target syscall args/resources/examples. Response parsed, validated, injected.

**Dashboard**: SyzGPT stats (generated/valid/injected) shown on `/ai` page.

**Files created**: `pkg/aitriage/prompt_syzgpt.go`, `syz-manager/syzgpt.go`
**Files modified**: `pkg/aitriage/aitriage.go` (stepC, callbacks), `syz-manager/ai_triage.go` (wiring), `pkg/fuzzer/stats.go` (stats), `pkg/manager/http.go` (dashboard), `html/ai.html`

### FlatBuffers (Phase 7)

Three new fields added to `ProgInfoRaw`:
- `ebpf_commit_creds_count` (field 13, VT=30)
- `ebpf_priv_esc_count` (field 14, VT=32)
- `ebpf_cross_cache_count` (field 15, VT=34)

`StartObject` changed from 13 to 16. Manual edits in `flatrpc.go` and `flatrpc.h`.

### Build

```bash
# BPF object (requires vmlinux.h — generate first if missing):
# bpftool btf dump file /path/to/vmlinux format c > syzkaller/executor/ebpf/vmlinux.h
clang -O2 -g -target bpf -D__TARGET_ARCH_x86 \
    -I executor/ebpf/ -I executor/ebpf/bpf/ \
    -c executor/ebpf/probe_ebpf.bpf.c \
    -o executor/ebpf/probe_ebpf.bpf.o

cd syzkaller && make host  # Builds all host tools including syz-manager
```

## Phase 8: Mutation & Coverage Innovation — IN PROGRESS (8a DONE)

**Goal**: Smarter mutation strategies, multi-objective optimization, and enhanced exploit detection. Total overhead < 3.5%, no additional AI API cost.

**Analysis basis**: Deep code-level review of `prog/mutation.go`, `pkg/fuzzer/dezzer.go`, `pkg/fuzzer/job.go`, and 15+ papers (NDSS/CCS/ICSE/ISSTA 2022-2025). Each technique evaluated for runtime performance impact, realistic effectiveness (not paper maximums), and synergy with existing PROBE architecture.

### 8a. Write-to-freed eBPF Detection — DONE

**Goal**: Detect writes to freed slab objects via `copy_from_user` kprobe — near-certain exploitability signal.

**Design**: kprobe on `_copy_from_user`, cross-reference destination address with `freed_objects` LRU map (Phase 5). Slab-alignment matching (64/128/256 bytes) to handle writes to offsets within freed objects. Epoch filter + 50ms time window to prevent stale false positives.

**Overhead**: < 1.5%. **Expected impact**: Strong exploitability signal for Focus Mode prioritization.

**UAF score contribution**: +30 (1+ writes), +50 (3+ writes). Focus mode triggered on any write-to-freed detection.

**Implementation**: Added to existing `probe_ebpf.bpf.c` (shares `freed_objects` map and `metrics` struct, separate BPF file unnecessary). FlatBuffers field `ebpf_write_to_freed_count` (VT=36, slot 16). Dashboard stat: "ebpf write-to-freed".

**Files modified**: `executor/ebpf/probe_ebpf.bpf.h`, `executor/ebpf/probe_ebpf.bpf.c`, `executor/executor_linux.h`, `executor/executor.cc`, `pkg/flatrpc/flatrpc.fbs`, `pkg/flatrpc/flatrpc.h`, `pkg/flatrpc/flatrpc.go`, `pkg/fuzzer/stats.go`, `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go`, `tools/syz-ebpf-loader/main.go`

### 8b. Operator-Pair Thompson Sampling (MuoFuzz)

**Goal**: Learn conditional probabilities between consecutive mutation operators — P(next_op success | prev_op).

**Source**: MuoFuzz (FuzzBench/MAGMA). Extends DEzzer from 5 independent distributions to 5×5 = 25 pair distributions.

**Design**: `alpha[prev_op][next_op]`, `beta[prev_op][next_op]` in DEzzer. Fallback to single-op TS when pair data < 50 records. Feature flag for on/off.

**Overhead**: < 0.1% (25 floats = 200 bytes, O(1) lookup). **Expected impact**: +5-10% mutation efficiency.

**Files**: `pkg/fuzzer/dezzer.go` (pair stats), `prog/mutation.go` (track prev_op in loop)

### 8c. Multi-Objective Meta-Bandit (MobFuzz)

**Goal**: Optimize for multiple objectives (coverage + memory_safety + priv_esc) instead of coverage alone.

**Source**: MobFuzz (NDSS 2022), adapted from user-space AFL to kernel fuzzing using existing eBPF signals.

**Design**: Meta-bandit architecture with independent TS per objective:
- Layer 0: UCB-1 selects objective (coverage / memory_safety / priv_esc) per 100-execution epoch
- Layer 1: Objective-specific operator TS (each objective has its own DEzzer weights)
- `memory_safety_score = uaf_base * 1.0 + cross_cache * 0.5 + double_free * 0.8`
- Dynamic coverage minimum: 70% (first 2h) → 50% (2-8h) → 30% (8h+)

**Sparse reward solution**: No reward amplification. Each objective has independent TS with own reward signal (event ratio within its epoch), eliminating the rare-event problem.

**AI integration**: AI strategy adjusts UCB priors (direction, not numerical hyperparameters), e.g., "increase memory_safety prior" → alpha_m += 10.

**Overhead**: < 0.5%. **Expected impact**: +50-100% high-risk bug discovery. **Implementation order**: Last (after 8a/8b/8e/8f/8d stabilize).

**Risk mitigation**: Maximum 3 objectives. Feature flag. Layered separation from operator TS.

**Files**: `pkg/fuzzer/dezzer.go` (meta-bandit, per-objective TS), `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go` (processResult routing), `pkg/aitriage/prompt_strategy.go` (objective weights in prompt)

### 8d. MOCK Context-Aware Dependency (BiGRU)

**Goal**: Learn syscall sequence dependencies via BiGRU language model for context-aware mutation.

**Source**: MOCK (NDSS 2024). BiGRU (embed=64, hidden=128, ~1-2MB model). Trains on corpus programs that triggered new coverage. Retrains every 2 hours. Top-k=15 sampling. UCB-1 balances static vs. context-aware mutation.

**Design**: Python subprocess (PyTorch) running as gRPC service. Go queries model during `insertCall()` with 50% probability (50% fallback to ChoiceTable). Health check every 5s, auto-restart on failure, fallback to existing ChoiceTable if Python down.

**Overhead**: < 1% (inference < 1ms via GPU, RTX 3070 Ti). Training: ~30s every 2h (non-blocking). **Expected impact**: +3-12% coverage (paper average, not +32% maximum).

**Cold start**: First hour uses static dependencies only (UCB-1 naturally handles this).

**Files**: `tools/mock_model/` (new Python package), `pkg/fuzzer/ngram.go` (Go client + gRPC), `prog/mutation.go` (insertCall integration), `syz-manager/manager.go` (subprocess lifecycle)

### 8e. Per-Cluster Thompson Sampling (SeamFuzz)

**Goal**: Maintain separate DEzzer weights per kernel subsystem cluster.

**Source**: SeamFuzz (ICSE 2023). Programs clustered by dominant syscall subsystem: fs, net, mm, ipc, device, other.

**Design**: Classify program at mutation time via majority-vote over call names (O(n), < 0.001ms). No caching on `prog.Prog` (stale after mutation). DEzzer maintains per-cluster alpha/beta arrays. Fallback to global TS when cluster data < 100 records.

**Overhead**: < 0.2%. **Expected impact**: +3-8% crash discovery (subsystem-specific optimization).

**Files**: `pkg/fuzzer/dezzer.go` (cluster state, per-cluster weights), `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go` (classifyProgram)

### 8f. Effective Component Inference (lightweight SeqFuzz)

**Goal**: Identify which syscalls in a program are essential for crash reproduction, focus mutation on them.

**Source**: SeqFuzz (Inscrypt 2025) concept, adapted as lightweight dynamic ablation (no static ICFG analysis).

**Design**: Focus job only. At focus job start: remove calls one-by-one, execute 3× each. Calls where removal prevents crash = essential. Focus mutation on essential calls (mutate_arg), replace non-essential calls (insert/splice). Skip ablation if program length < 5. Cache results per crash title.

**Overhead**: 5-15 extra executions at focus job start (< 1s). **Expected impact**: 2-3x focus job efficiency.

**Files**: `pkg/fuzzer/job.go` (focusJob ablation phase), `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go` (ablation cache)

### Phase 8 Implementation Order

```
8a (Write-to-freed) → 8b (Op-pair TS) → 8e (Cluster TS) → 8f (Effective Component) → 8d (MOCK BiGRU) → 8c (Multi-obj, last)
```

Rationale: 8a is simplest with immediate value. 8b/8e extend DEzzer incrementally. 8f enhances Focus Mode. 8d requires Python infrastructure. 8c depends on 8a providing new objective signals and all other features being stable.

### Phase 8 Risk Summary

| Risk | Subphase | Prob | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------|--------|------------|
| copy_from_user overhead | 8a | Med | Med | Address range pre-filter (slab heap only) |
| cache_freed stale entry | 8a | High | Med | 50ms time window + 3-execution statistical confirmation |
| Pair distribution slow convergence | 8b | Med | Low | Single-op fallback when pair data < 50 |
| Objective conflict (coverage vs UAF) | 8c | High | High | Meta-bandit with independent TS per objective, dynamic coverage floor |
| Sparse eBPF reward signals | 8c | High | High | Per-objective epoch ratio (eliminates amplification) |
| DEzzer complexity explosion | 8b+c+e | Med | High | Layered separation + feature flags + incremental activation |
| Python↔Go IPC instability | 8d | Med | High | gRPC + health check + auto-fallback to ChoiceTable |
| Model quality = corpus quality | 8d | Med | Med | UCB-1 auto-balancing + rollback on regression |
| Flaky crash ablation misclassification | 8f | High | Med | 3× repetition + deflake reuse |
| Cumulative overhead | All | Med | Med | Per-feature measurement, disable if > 5% |

### Phase 8 Verification

Each sub-phase: `go build` + `go vet` → 1h fuzzing (exec/sec baseline) → 4h run (crash discovery comparison).

## Phase 6+: Advanced Improvements Roadmap

**Full roadmap**: See `syzkaller/probe_log/improvement_roadmap.md` for detailed descriptions, paper references, and cost projections.
