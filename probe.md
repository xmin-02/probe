# PROBE — Custom Syzkaller for Exploit-Oriented Kernel Fuzzing

## Scope

- **Modification target**: `syzkaller/` directory ONLY
- **Linux kernel source**: NEVER modified (kernel .config changes are allowed)
- **Goal**: Transform syzkaller from a general-purpose fuzzer into an exploit-oriented fuzzer that focuses on discovering and validating actually exploitable vulnerabilities

## Target Vulnerability Types

- **UAF (Use-After-Free)**: alloc → use → free → reuse patterns
- **OOB (Out-of-Bounds)**: buffer size/offset boundary violations

```

## Phase 1: Crash Filtering & Dedup Pipeline [DONE]

**Goal**: Eliminate noise and deduplicate crashes while preserving variant diversity.

**Current problem**: syzkaller treats all crashes equally — WARNING, LOCKDEP, hangs, and KASAN UAF writes all get the same treatment. Duplicate crashes flood the results.

### 1a. Crash Severity Tiers

**Modification targets**:
- `pkg/report/crash/` — crash type classification
- `pkg/manager/` — crash storage and reporting logic

**Implementation**:
- Use existing `impactOrder` ranking in `pkg/report/impact_score.go`
- Add filtering layer in manager: only prioritize crashes with high impact scores
- Crash severity tiers:
  - **Tier 1 (Critical)**: KASANInvalidFree, KASANUseAfterFreeWrite, KASANWrite, KASANUseAfterFreeRead, KASANRead
  - **Tier 2 (Important)**: OOB variants, KFENCEInvalidFree, NullPtrDerefBUG, Warning, Bug, UBSAN, LockdepBug, AtomicSleep, UnexpectedReboot; also the default for any unclassified crash type
  - **Tier 3 (Stats-only)**: LostConnection, SyzFailure, Hang, DoS, MemoryLeak (explicit list only)
- Tier 3 handling: **statistics only** (no logs, no reports, no repro)
  - Record title + count in `tier3-stat.json` (e.g., "WARNING in xxx: 47 times")
  - No disk-heavy storage — only counters
  - Viewable in web dashboard (collapsed section)
  - Never triggers Focus Mode or repro attempts

### 1b. Crash Deduplication Pipeline

**Key principle**: Group, don't delete. Same crash point can have different trigger paths with different exploitability.

```
Crashes (thousands/day)
    |
    +-- Stage 1: Exact duplicate removal
    |       Match: title + stack trace + trigger program hash
    |       Only removes 100% identical crashes
    |
    +-- Stage 2: Grouping (NOT deletion)
    |       Group by: same stack trace / crash point
    |       But PRESERVE different trigger programs (syscall sequences)
    |       → Each group contains multiple variants
    |
    |       Example: "UAF at kfree+0x42" group (5 variants)
    |         ├─ Variant A: close() → read()      (read UAF)
    |         ├─ Variant B: close() → write()     (write UAF) ← more dangerous
    |         ├─ Variant C: close() → ioctl()     (ioctl UAF)
    |         ├─ Variant D: munmap() → read()     (different free path)
    |         └─ Variant E: munmap() → mmap()     (reallocation attempt)
    |
    +-- Stage 3: Impact score filter
    |       Tier 3: statistics only (title + count), no storage
    |       Tier 1/2: proceed to grouping + full storage
    |
    +-- Stage 4: AI analysis (group-level, not per-crash)
            Send: group representative + all variant trigger programs
            → LLM identifies which variant is most exploitable
            → Variant diversity = more options for Focus Mode
```

**Why grouping matters**: Same crash point ≠ same exploitability. A write-UAF and read-UAF at the same location have vastly different exploit potential. Deleting "duplicates" loses attack vectors that Focus Mode needs.

**VariantPrograms cap**: Loading variant programs is capped at `MaxVariants` (100) to prevent excessive disk I/O when a crash group accumulates thousands of variants.

## Phase 2: Focus Mode [DONE]

**Goal**: When a high-severity crash is found, switch to intensive exploitation of that finding.

**Current behavior**: Crash found → triage → minimize → smash (25 mutations) → move on.

**New behavior**:
```
Normal Mode (exploration)
    |
    +-- Crash detected
          |
          +-- Low severity → Standard processing (25x smash)
          |
          +-- High severity (Tier 1) → FOCUS MODE
                |
                +-- 1. Intensive mutation of crash program
                |     +-- 300 iterations (vs 25 in smash)
                |     +-- Standard prog.Mutate() (Phase 4 adds UAF/OOB-specific)
                |
                +-- 2. Diminishing returns exit
                |     +-- 50 consecutive iterations with no new coverage → early exit
                |     +-- Tracks max signal growth for progress detection
                |
                +-- 3. Concurrency limits
                      +-- Max 1 concurrent focus job
                      +-- Pending queue: up to 8 candidates queued while focus active
                      +-- On completion, next pending candidate auto-launches
                      +-- Same crash title never re-focused
                      +-- Alternate(2): 1 focus request per 2 queue polls
```

**Implementation**:
- `pkg/fuzzer/job.go` — `focusJob` type (300 iters, diminishing returns exit)
- `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go` — `focusQueue`, `AddFocusCandidate()`, focus state tracking
- `pkg/fuzzer/cover.go` — `MaxSignalLen()` for progress detection
- `pkg/fuzzer/stats.go` — `statJobsFocus`, `statExecFocus`
- `syz-manager/manager.go` — Tier 1 crash → Focus Mode trigger bridge

**Queue priority** (implemented):
```
1. triageCandidateQueue
2. candidateQueue
3. triageQueue
4. focusQueue (Alternate 2)  ← PROBE: high-severity crash intensive mutation
5. smashQueue (Alternate 3)
6. genFuzz
```

**Logging strategy**:
- Entry: `Logf(0)` — `PROBE: focus mode started for 'X' (tier N)`
- Exit:  `Logf(0)` — `PROBE: focus mode ended for 'X' — iters, new_coverage, exit_reason, duration`
- Mid-session: no logs (internal counters only, summarized at exit)

## Phase 3: AI-Guided Fuzzing — **DONE**

**Goal**: Integrate LLM into the full fuzzing pipeline — crash exploitability analysis, coverage strategy, seed generation, mutation tuning, and Focus target recommendations.

**Architecture**: 2-step batch cycle every 1 hour:
- **Step A**: Crash analysis (individual API calls per crash group, scoring 0-100)
- **Step B**: Fuzzing strategy (single API call with coverage+crash summary, produces syscall weights, seeds, mutation hints, focus targets)

**Model**: Configurable (recommended: Claude Sonnet 4.5, ~$1.25/day). Multi-provider support (Anthropic + OpenAI-compatible).

**Config** (`probe.cfg`):
```json
"ai_triage": {
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    "api_key": "sk-ant-api03-xxx",
    "max_tier": 2
}
```
Provider auto-detected from model name (`claude-*` → Anthropic, otherwise → OpenAI).

### What was implemented

**New package `pkg/aitriage/`**:
- `aitriage.go` — Core types (TriageResult, StrategyResult, CostTracker), Triager with 1-hour batch loop
- `client.go` — LLMClient interface + Anthropic/OpenAI implementations (raw net/http, 3x retry, 60s timeout)
- `prompt_crash.go` — KASAN report parser, crash exploitability prompt (5 criteria, JSON output)
- `prompt_strategy.go` — FuzzingSnapshot collection, strategy prompt (syscall weights, seeds, mutations, focus)

**Strategy application**:
- `prog/prio.go`: `ChoiceTable.ApplyWeights()` — external syscall weight multipliers on cumulative sums
- `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go`: `InjectSeed()` — parse syzkaller program text, inject as triage candidate
- `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go`: `ApplyAIWeights()` — forward weights to ChoiceTable
- Focus targets → `AddFocusCandidate()` for high-score crashes

**Dashboard**:
- `main.html`: AI Score column on crash table (color-coded: red 70+, yellow 40-69, green 0-39)
- `crash.html`: AI Exploitability Analysis section (score, class, vuln type)
- `ai.html`: `/ai` page — status, cost tracking (USD+KRW), crash analysis table, strategy details, API call history, manual trigger buttons; auto-refreshes when LLM batch completes
- `aianalytics.html`: `/ai/analytics` page — comprehensive analytics with Google Charts (daily cost bar, cost breakdown pie, cumulative cost line, score distribution, exploit class pie, API calls per day), data tables for token efficiency, vulnerability types, strategy runs
- `common.html`: AI tab in navigation bar

**Manager integration** (`syz-manager/ai_triage.go`):
- Triager initialization from config, background goroutine
- Callbacks: GetCrashes, GetSnapshot, OnTriageResult, OnStrategyResult
- Score >= 70 → auto-trigger Focus Mode
- Manual triggers: POST `/api/ai/analyze`, POST `/api/ai/strategize`

**Graceful degradation**: No `ai_triage` config → triager nil, AI disabled, `/ai` shows "disabled", fuzzing unchanged.

**Operational improvements**:
- **Step A re-analysis**: Crashes are re-analyzed when variant count triples since last analysis (e.g., 5→15 variants), capturing evolving exploit potential as new trigger paths are discovered
- **Cost recovery dedup**: Timestamp-based guard prevents double-counting when recovering cost history from triage result files at startup
- **Auto-refresh**: `/ai` page automatically reloads when LLM batch completes (tracks running→complete transition)

### Cost Estimate (24h, ~126K input + ~58K output tokens)

| Model | 24h USD | 24h KRW | Note |
|-------|---------|---------|------|
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | $1.25 | ~1,810 | Recommended |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | $0.42 | ~609 | Budget |
| GPT-4o | $0.90 | ~1,305 | OpenAI |
| GPT-4o-mini | $0.05 | ~73 | Minimum |

## Phase 4: Practical Hardening — **DONE**

**Goal**: Practical improvements to boost UAF/OOB crash discovery before Phase 5.

**Modified files**: `setup/probe.cfg`, `pkg/manager/crash.go`, `pkg/fuzzer/fuzzer.go`, `prog/mutation.go`, `prog/size.go`, `prog/hints.go`

### 4a. kasan_multi_shot + Severity Escalation — **DONE**
- Removed `oops=panic` and added `kasan_multi_shot` to kernel cmdline
- Added `escalateCrashType()`: scans all reports (primary + tail) for the most severe crash type when multiple KASAN reports exist in one execution
- Called from `SaveCrash()` before tier classification

### 4b. Fault Injection × Focus Mode — **DONE**
- When Focus Mode starts for a high-severity crash, also spawns `faultInjectionJob` for each call in the crash program
- Error paths (incomplete cleanup) are a major source of UAFs
- Reuses existing `statExecFaultInject` counter, jobs go through `focusQueue`

### 4c. Hints OOB Boundary Extension — **DONE**
- Extended `checkConstArg()` in `prog/hints.go` to generate boundary±1/±2 variants after standard replacers
- Standard hints generate values that PASS comparisons; OOB variants generate values that FAIL boundary checks (off-by-one/off-by-two)
- Applies `uselessHint` filter to avoid invalid boundary values

### 4d. LenType Priority Boost + OOB-Aware Mutation — **DONE**
- Boosted `LenType` mutation priority from `0.1 * maxPriority` (6.4) to `0.4 * maxPriority` (25.6)
- Added OOB-specific strategy to `mutateSize()` (20% chance): off-by-one above/below, double size, zero size, page-size overshoot
- Strategy uses actual buffer size (from `assignSizesCall`) as reference, `preserve=true` prevents recalculation

## Phase 5: eBPF Runtime Monitor — **DONE**

**Goal**: Real-time kernel heap state tracking for exploitability assessment.

**Constraint**: Runs inside Guest VM, attaches to existing kernel tracepoints. NO kernel source modification.

```

### 5a. BPF C Program — **DONE**
- `executor/ebpf/probe_ebpf.bpf.c` — hooks `tracepoint/kmem/kfree` and `tracepoint/kmem/kmalloc`
- LRU hash map (8192 entries) tracks recently freed pointers with timestamps
- Array map stores per-execution metrics: alloc_count, free_count, reuse_count, rapid_reuse_count, min_reuse_delay_ns, double_free_count, size_mismatch_count
- Detects slab reuse (free→alloc of same pointer) and rapid reuse (< 100us = UAF-favorable)
- **Double-free detection**: kfree checks if ptr already exists in freed_objects (freed twice without intervening alloc)
- **Size-mismatch detection**: kmalloc flags when `bytes_alloc > 2 * bytes_req && bytes_alloc >= 128` (cross-cache/slab waste)

### 5b. BPF Loader — **DONE**
- `tools/syz-ebpf-loader/main.go` — standalone Go binary using `cilium/ebpf`
- Loads BPF ELF object, attaches tracepoints, pins maps+links to `/sys/fs/bpf/probe/`
- Static binary for VM deployment; exits after setup (BPF persists in kernel)

### 5c. FlatBuffers Schema Extension — **DONE**
- Added 8 fields to `ProgInfoRaw` in `pkg/flatrpc/flatrpc.fbs`:
  - `ebpf_alloc_count`, `ebpf_free_count`, `ebpf_reuse_count`, `ebpf_rapid_reuse_count` (uint32)
  - `ebpf_min_reuse_ns` (uint64), `ebpf_uaf_score` (uint32)
  - `ebpf_double_free_count` (uint32, VT=26), `ebpf_size_mismatch_count` (uint32, VT=28)
- Backward compatible: default 0 for old executors
- Manual hand-edit of generated `flatrpc.h` (C++) and `flatrpc.go` (Go) since flatc version mismatch prevents regeneration

### 5d. Executor C++ Integration — **DONE**
- `executor_linux.h`: `ebpf_init()` opens pinned metrics map via raw `bpf()` syscall; `access()` check before `BPF_OBJ_GET` to silently skip when map not yet pinned
- `ebpf_read_and_reset()`: reads metrics + zeros for next execution (atomic)
- `executor.cc`: init on startup (with retry in `execute_one()` for late BPF deployment), clear before execution, child writes metrics to `OutputData` shared memory BEFORE `close_fds()`, runner reads from shared memory in `finish_output()`
- UAF score formula: rapid_reuse > 0 (+50), min_delay < 10us (+30), reuse > 5 (+20), double_free > 0 (=100 override), size_mismatch > 3 (+10), capped at 100

### 5e. Manager Deployment — **DONE**
- Manager copies `syz-ebpf-loader` + `probe_ebpf.bpf.o` to each VM at startup
- Runs loader via shell command chain before executor starts
- bpffs mount added to VM fstab (`tools/trixie/etc/fstab`)
- Graceful degradation: if eBPF fails, executor returns zero metrics, fuzzing continues
- **Bugfix (v1)**: All eBPF command output redirected to `/dev/null` to prevent crash reporter interference
- **Bugfix (v2)**: Root cause was VM image missing bpffs mountpoint + loader hang potential. Fixed: `mkdir -p /sys/fs/bpf` before mount, `timeout 10` on loader to prevent hang blocking executor, loader output saved to `/tmp/probe-ebpf.log` for debugging. VM image fstab updated with bpffs entry. BPF header `accounted` field removed for kernel 6.1.20 compatibility.
- **Bugfix (v3)**: `ebpf_init()` was called too early in `executor.cc` (before shmem fd operations), so `BPF_OBJ_GET` would steal fd 5/6 (`kMaxSignalFd`/`kCoverFilterFd`) when the runner didn't provide coverage filter. The `fcntl()` check then misidentified the BPF map fd as a shmem fd, causing `mmap` to fail on all VMs. Fixed: moved `ebpf_init()` to after all shmem fd operations (`mmap_input`, `mmap_output`, CoverFilter setup) in executor.cc exec mode. Also cleaned up diagnostic code: removed `/tmp/shmem-diag.txt` file writing from `shmem.h`, removed tier3 raw output logging from `manager.go`. Kept improved error message in `shmem.h` (with errno, fd, size info).
- **Bugfix (v4)**: eBPF metrics were always 0 on the Go (manager) side despite BPF programs collecting data. Root cause: `close_fds()` in `common_linux.h` calls `close_range(3, MAX_FDS, 0)` which closes ALL fds >= 3 including the BPF map fd. The eBPF read in `finish_output()` happened AFTER `close_fds()` in a different process (runner), so `BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM` failed on the already-closed fd. Fixed: (1) exec child reads eBPF metrics BEFORE `close_fds()` and writes them to `OutputData` shared memory via atomic fields, (2) runner's `finish_output()` reads from shared memory instead of calling `ebpf_read_and_reset()` directly, (3) added `ebpf_init()` retry in `execute_one()` for late BPF deployment, (4) added `access()` check in `ebpf_init()` before `BPF_OBJ_GET`. Verified: alloc/free counts non-zero from first execution.
- **Bugfix (v5)**: eBPF UAF score saturated to 100 for ALL programs over time (~5000+ executions). Root cause: `freed_objects` LRU map was never cleared between program executions, so freed pointers from program N appeared as "reuse" in program N+1, causing unbounded accumulation. Fixed: `ebpf_read_and_reset()` now iterates `freed_objects` map with `BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY` + `BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM` loop (all 8192 entries per reset) to clear stale entries. Opened pinned freed_objects map via `ebpf_open_pinned()` helper alongside metrics map.
- **Bugfix (v6)**: Saturation guard in `finish_output()` — if `reuse > 500` (physically impossible per single program execution), suppress scoring entirely. Prevents residual saturation from overwhelming Focus Mode.

### 5f. Fuzzer Feedback — **DONE**
- `processResult()`: tracks `statEbpfAllocs`, `statEbpfReuses`, `statEbpfUafDetected`, `statEbpfDoubleFree`, `statEbpfSizeMismatch` stats
- Non-crashing UAF detection: UAF score ≥ 70 triggers `AddFocusCandidate()` → Focus Mode
- **Double-free Focus**: Any double-free detection triggers Focus Mode
- **Unified eBPF cooldown**: Both UAF and double-free Focus triggers share a single 5-min cooldown (`lastEbpfFocus` timestamp) to prevent Focus over-triggering
- Stats visible in web dashboard: `ebpf reuses` (rate), `ebpf uaf` (count), `ebpf double-free` (count), `ebpf size-mismatch` (rate) — all on `ebpf` graph

### 5g. Stability Hardening — **DONE**
Five production stability fixes applied to fuzzer core:

1. **eBPF saturation guard** (`executor.cc`): `reuse > 500` suppresses UAF scoring. Prevents residual freed_objects accumulation from causing all programs to score 100.
2. **Candidates counter fix** (`fuzzer.go`): `InjectSeed()` and `InjectProgram()` no longer use `progCandidate` flag or increment `statCandidates`. AI-injected seeds are not corpus triage candidates — mixing them caused the counter to go negative over time.
3. **Focus job cooldown** (`fuzzer.go`): `drainFocusPending()` enforces 2-min minimum between consecutive Focus jobs. Stale pending entries cleared on cooldown miss to prevent unbounded growth of the pending queue.
4. **ChoiceTable RWMutex** (`fuzzer.go`): `ctMu` changed from `sync.Mutex` to `sync.RWMutex`. `ChoiceTable()` (read-only, called on every mutation) uses `RLock()` for better concurrency. Writes (`updateChoiceTable`) continue using exclusive `Lock()`.
5. **focusTitles memory cap** (`fuzzer.go`): `focusTitles` dedup map capped at 10,000 entries. When exceeded, map is cleared and refilled from active Focus jobs only, preventing unbounded memory growth in long runs.

### Key Design Decisions
- **Separate loader + executor reads**: Loader handles complex BPF loading (cilium/ebpf), executor does simple map reads (raw bpf() syscall). Clean separation.
- **Tracepoints over kprobes**: `tracepoint/kmem/kfree` and `tracepoint/kmem/kmalloc` are stable ABI.
- **LRU hash map**: freed_objects uses LRU to auto-evict old entries, preventing unbounded growth.
- **Graceful degradation**: If eBPF isn't available, fuzzing continues normally with zero metrics.

### Build
```bash
cd syzkaller
make              # Builds executor with eBPF support
make probe_ebpf   # Builds BPF object + loader to bin/linux_amd64/
```

## Development Rules

1. **Plan before code**: Before implementing each Phase, MUST discuss and agree on a detailed development plan first. No coding without prior discussion.
2. **Update docs**: After significant changes, update both `probe.md` (EN) and `probe_kor.md` (KR), then push to GitHub.
3. **Scope**: Only modify `syzkaller/` directory. Never touch Linux kernel source.

## Implementation Order

| Phase | Component | Difficulty | Impact | Dependencies |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Crash Filtering & Dedup Pipeline | Low | Immediate noise reduction + variant preservation | None | **DONE** |
| 2 | Focus Mode | Medium | Deep exploitation of high-severity findings | Phase 1 (needs severity tiers) | **DONE** |
| 3 | AI Triage (Claude Haiku 4.5) | Medium | Smart group-level crash analysis | Phase 1 (needs dedup groups), Phase 2 (needs Focus Mode) |
| 4 | Practical Hardening (UAF/OOB) | Medium | Higher vuln discovery rate | None (can parallel with 2-3) | **DONE** |
| 5 | eBPF Runtime Monitor | High | Real-time exploitability feedback | Phase 2 (needs Focus Mode feedback loop) | **DONE** |

**Critical path**: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 (sequential dependency)
**Parallel track**: Phase 4 can start any time independently
